## Engine Locking

We would like for all developers working on this project to use the same Node engine and package manager we are using. To do that we create two new files:

- .nvmrc - Will tell other uses of the project which version of Node is used
- .npmrc - Will tell other users of the project which package manager is used

- Add engines in package.json
